Version control on GitHub refers to the practice of managing and tracking changes to code or 
files over time using Git, a distributed version control system. GitHub provides a platform to 
host repositories, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of changes. It allows 
developers to:

- Track changes to their codebase.
- Collaborate with team members using branches and pull requests.
- Revert to previous versions if needed.
- Manage contributions from multiple developers.

To get started with version control on GitHub:

1. WORKING DIRECTORY
    Initialize a Git repository locally using `git init`. 
        - Use "ls -a" to look for hidden folder in terminal since git will be one of them.
        - To check which files are in staging zone (working zone) : `git status`
2. STAGING AREA
    Add and commit changes using `git add` and `git commit`.
        - Add savepoint with : `git commit -m "Message (in present tense)"
        - To check the commits : `git log`
        - To add multiple commits : `git commit .`.
        - Compare changes in a specific file using `git diff filename`.
        - Switch between branches or restore files using `git checkout branch_name` or 
          `git checkout filename`.
        - Remove files from the staging area without deleting them from the working directory 
          using `git rm --cached -r .`.

3. Push the repository to GitHub using `git push`.
    - Link the local repository to a remote repository using `git remote add origin <repository_url>`.
    - Push changes to the remote repository using `git push -u <local> <remote>`.

4. Cloning a repository(Github to Local files)
    - Clone an existing repository from GitHub using `git clone <repository_url>`.
    - This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.
    - You can start working on the cloned repository immediately.

5. Branching and Merging
  - Create a new branch using `git branch <branch_name>`.
  - Switch to the new branch using `git checkout <branch_name>` or `git switch <branch_name>`.
  - Merge changes from one branch into another using `git merge <branch_name>`.
  - Resolve merge conflicts manually if they arise, then commit the resolved changes.
  - To create a new branch AND check it out at the same time, you can simply type git checkout -b [yourbranchname]
  - Delete a branch after merging using `git branch -d <branch_name>`.
